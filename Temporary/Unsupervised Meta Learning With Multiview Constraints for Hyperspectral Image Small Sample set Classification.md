## I. Introduction
> Background
> HSI是地球觀測拍攝中很重要的部分

Since the 1970s, remote sensing technology has become one of the most important technical means to obtain earth observation information. 

Compared with panchromatic and multispectral images, HSIs contain both rich spectral details and spatial structure information, providing the possibility for accurate identification and classification [1].
