### Reading purpose

### Judgment


## 1. Introduction

### Background

Some scholars and practitioners have argued that automation technologies such as AI will have a particularly disruptive effect on the workforce (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014).

A 2017 report by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) suggested that, depending on the speed of AI adoption, 75 million to 375 million workers (from 3–14% of the global workforce) may be required to change occupations and/or upgrade their skills by 2030 (Manyika et al., 2017). 

### Motivation

While computer anxiety has received much attention among researchers, few studies have evaluated AIA among the general public. Several psychological scales such as the computer anxiety scale (Charlton & Birkett, 1995; Cohen & Waugh, 1989; Heinssen et al., 1987; Marcoulides, 1989), mobile computer anxiety scale (Wang, 2007), Internet anxiety scale (Chou, 2003), and robot anxiety scale (Nomura, Suzuki, Kanda, & Kato, 2006) have been used in prior studies to assess how individuals perceive and adopt information technology (IT).

unlike its peer anxieties, AIA may result from inaccurate perceptions of technological development, confusion about autonomy, and sociotechnical blindness (Johnson & Verdicchio, 2017).

### Purpose

The order of scale development is as follows: (1) identify all AIA aspects for inclusion in a single measurement instrument; (2) explore interrelationships among the AIA dimensions; (3) develop an assessment tool that evaluates AIA more accurately than currently available instruments; and (4) contribute additional important AIA-related theories to the IS literature.

## 2. Theoretical foundation

### 2.1. Technophobia and anxiety

Specifically, anxiety (e.g. computer anxiety) should not be confused with holding a negative attitude (e.g. negative attitude toward computers), which involves beliefs and feelings regarding computer-related technology rather than emotional responses toward using technology (Heinssen, Glass, & Knight, 1984, 1987). 

Moreover, negative attitudes may not significantly impact actual advanced-technology-related behaviors (Nomura et al., 2006). Therefore, this study focuses on anxiety in order to discover the deeper, internal factors that are associated with AI.

### 2.2. Conceptualization of AIA

Establishing a conceptual definition and theoretical meaning for constructs is a critical part of developing reliable measures and obtaining useful and effective results (Gerbing & Anderson, 1988). 

Although the fields of computer anxiety and robot anxiety have been studied in great detail, the effects of AIA remain largely unknown. Based on prior anxiety studies conducted in the AI field (e.g. Johnson & Verdicchio, 2017), AIA may be defined as an overall, affective response of anxiety or fear that inhibits an individual from interacting with AI.

Moreover, AIA in the present research context focuses on the variable itself, rather than the process of response or model evaluation, which promotes the operation of AIA as a single variable, independent of numerous antecedents or consequences.

### 2.3. A theoretical framework for assessing AIA

The phrase “AI anxiety” refers to feelings of fear or agitation about out-of-control AI (Johnson & Verdicchio, 2017).

As the main purpose of developing an AIA measure is to predict behavior, measuring self-perceived fear and unease about AI technologies/products is necessarily closely linked to behavior theory.

The effects of anxiety may be either facilitating or debilitating. Facilitating anxiety enhances performance, whereas debilitating anxiety inhibits performance (Alpert & Haber, 1960). Surprisingly, the facilitating aspect of anxiety has rarely been studied in the context of IT.

Bernazzani (2017) pointed out that AI technologies/products are likely to replace some jobs. Moreover, people may be required to change careers and improve their skills. This leads to the assumption that AIA may affect professional skill development positively, as individuals with a high degree of AIA tend to have a higher degree of motivated learning behavior. To validate the proposed nomological validity of the AIAS (Churchill, 1995), the following hypothesis is proposed:

**H1.** A positive correlation exists between AIA scores and motivated learning behavior.

## 3. Research method

### 3.1. Generation of scale items

In terms of operations, AIA may be seen as a total rating of anxiety about different attributes. This study adopted 59 items to represent the various dimensions of the AIA construct in order to generate a preliminary item pool for the AIAS.

In order to ensure the inclusion of all key attributes and items, this item pool was reviewed by two IS professors, two AI experts, and four AI technology/product users. This review resulted in the recommended deletion of nine items due to redundancy.

### 3.2. The sample and procedures
To improve the generalizability of the results, the data used to develop the AIAS were collected through an online survey in Taiwan. The questionnaire was uploaded to a survey portal (https://www.surveycake.com) for online users to complete.

The online survey yielded 301 usable responses from participants of differen t demographic backgrounds. Table 1 summarizes the respondents’ demographic information.

## 4. Scale development

### 4.1. Item analysis and reliability estimates

Any corrected item-to-total correlation below 0.40 resulted in the deletion of its associated item. The corrected item-to-total correlations of two items, Q31 and Q50, fell below 0.40 and were therefore deleted. The remaining 48-item instrument had high reliability (coefficient alpha = 0.986).

-   Q31. The development of humanoid AI techniques/products (e.g. humanoid robots) is blasphemous.
-   Q50. I think that only people who are no longer independent would use an assistive AI product.

### 4.2. Identifying the factor structure of the AIAS

Before using EFA to identify the elemental structure of the AIA construct, Bartlett’s sphericity test was performed with significant results (χ2 = 19774.6; p < 0.001),  showing that the factor analysis valuable

The PCA findings show that the four factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 accounted for 79.638% of the extracted total variance in the AIAS. 

This study followed the five rules that are often used as the criteria for deciding whether to retain or eliminate items: (1) values larger than the basic root criterion (eigenvalue >1.00); (2) insignificant factor loadings (<0.50); (3) significant factor loadings on multiple factors; (4) at least three indicators or items in a single factor; and (5) single item factors.

Based on these five rules and the EFA results, the present research study retained four dimensions (factors), with the final set of 21 items used for the subsequent analysis and coefficient alpha results.

These four dimensions were interpreted as learning, job replacement, sociotechnical blindness, and AI configuration.

No cross-loading items were found among the four factors, in support of the discriminant validity of the AIAS.

- Learning
	- Q3. Learning to understand all of the special functions associated with an AI technique/product makes me anxious.
- Job replacement
	- Q16. I am afraid that an AI technique/product may make us dependent.
- Sociotechnical blindness
	- Q45. I am afraid that an AI technique/product may be misused.
- AI configuration
	- Q29. I find humanoid AI techniques/products (e.g. humanoid robots) scary.

### 4.3. Reliability

A coefficient alpha of 0.964 was obtained for this study, exceeding the minimum 0.70 recommended by Hair et al. (2010). 

The reliability of each of the four factors was: learning = 0.974; job replacement = 0.917; sociotechnical blindness = 0.917; and AI configuration = 0.961.

In addition, considering a minimum value of 0.30 (Nurosis, 1994), in order to improve the coefficient alpha levels, a corrected item-to-total correlation was performed. As shown in Table 3, each item had a corrected item-to-total correlation exceeding 0.40.

### 4.4. Content validity

In this study, the content validity of the AIAS was established via the rigorous procedure of conceptualizing the AIA construct, creation of the AIA items, and purification of the AIA scale.

### 4.5. Criterion-related validity

The results show a criterion-related validity of 0.864 for the 21-item instrument and a significance level of 0.001, indicating acceptable criterion-related validity (Cohen, 1988).

### 4.6. Discriminant and convergent validity

The minimum within-item correlations were learning = 0.624; job replacement = 0.480; sociotechnical blindness = 0.703; and AI configuration = 0.860. These correlations were significantly different from zero at the level of p < 0.001 and sufficient to justify further examination of discriminant validity.

### 4.7. Nomological validity
In the current study, nomological validity was evaluated by testing H1. 

The AIA construct and the total score of the behavioral intention construct (i.e. motivated learning behavior) should be positively correlated if the 21-item instrument has nomological validity.

A subsequent correlation analysis found that the AIA construct had a significantly positive effect on the behavioral intention construct (r = 0.190, p < 0.01).

## 5. Theoretical implications

The AIA construct in the AI area differs somewhat from both the computer-anxiety and robot-anxiety constructs. It is worth reiterating here that the developed AIAS incorporates three dissimilar components: (1) learning (similar to the computer-anxiety construct); (2) AI configuration (similar to the robot-anxiety construct), and (3) job placement and sociotechnical blindness (unique to the AIA construct).

Moreover, the AIAS may be utilized to compare individual perceptions of anxiety toward using specific AI technologies/products in terms of its four factors. The AIAS was designed to accommodate a wide range of AI technologies/products and to provide an evaluation framework for conducting comparative analyses.

According to the initial research findings, AIA, as a facilitating anxiety, influences motivated learning behavior to some extent. This is consistent with the findings of Kleinmann (1977) and Piniel and Csizér (2013)

Currently, however, empirical evidence on the link between AIA and learning behaviors is very limited. Accordingly, the AIAS has the potential to provide IS researchers with an evidence-based basis to interpret, justify, and compare the differences between different outcomes.

## 6. Practical implications

Providing AI technology/product-related education and learning channels will enable end users to increase their related knowledge and reduce their AIA, which should subsequently influence learning behaviors.

Also, for instructors, understanding the interaction between students’ AIA and learning behaviors is vital because the interventions can be adjusted as required.

Based on the different dimensions of AIA (i.e. learning, job replacement, sociotechnical blindness, and AI configuration), instructors are advised to use the proposed AIAS to understand how to apply more effective teaching strategies to stimulate students’ interest in learning AI-related knowledge and skills, perhaps by emphasizing the importance of relevant knowledge and practical skills for the students’ later vocations.

## 7. Limitations

First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) must be applied in future studies on the AIAS in order to examine the hypotheses and generate path analysis diagrams that explain factors and variables (Child, 2006).

Further, nonrandom sampling may limit the generalizability of research results due to lack of representativeness in populations beyond those sampled. In order to reduce sampling bias risk, future scholars are encouraged to use a randomized sample that involves different territories and countries.

Lastly, to establish the short-term and long-term stability of this instrument, assessment of the test-retest reliability of the AIAS should be performed.

## 8. Conclusions

The main contributions of this study include the development of a generic instrument for measuring anxiety toward AI development and the findings pertaining to the relationships between AIA and motivated learning behavior in individuals.

The findings of this study provide a preliminary insight into the relationship between AIA and motivated learning behavior. However, more research in this area is required. In order to determine how these concepts are related to each other, other methods including cross-sectional studies will be useful in terms of analyzing a representative subset including AIA, learning behaviors and other potential factors on relevant learning processes at a particular time.

The AIAS demonstrates satisfactory reliability and validity across various AI technologies/products. Educators, scholars, and practitioners are encouraged to employ the AIAS in AI and learning environments.
