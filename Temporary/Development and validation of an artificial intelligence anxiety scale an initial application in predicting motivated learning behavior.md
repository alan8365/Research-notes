### Reading purpose

### Judgment


## 1. Introduction

### Background

Some scholars and practitioners have argued that automation technologies such as AI will have a particularly disruptive effect on the workforce (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014).

A 2017 report by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) suggested that, depending on the speed of AI adoption, 75 million to 375 million workers (from 3–14% of the global workforce) may be required to change occupations and/or upgrade their skills by 2030 (Manyika et al., 2017). 

### Motivation

While computer anxiety has received much attention among researchers, few studies have evaluated AIA among the general public. Several psychological scales such as the computer anxiety scale (Charlton & Birkett, 1995; Cohen & Waugh, 1989; Heinssen et al., 1987; Marcoulides, 1989), mobile computer anxiety scale (Wang, 2007), Internet anxiety scale (Chou, 2003), and robot anxiety scale (Nomura, Suzuki, Kanda, & Kato, 2006) have been used in prior studies to assess how individuals perceive and adopt information technology (IT).

unlike its peer anxieties, AIA may result from inaccurate perceptions of technological development, confusion about autonomy, and sociotechnical blindness (Johnson & Verdicchio, 2017).

### Purpose

The order of scale development is as follows: (1) identify all AIA aspects for inclusion in a single measurement instrument; (2) explore interrelationships among the AIA dimensions; (3) develop an assessment tool that evaluates AIA more accurately than currently available instruments; and (4) contribute additional important AIA-related theories to the IS literature.

## 2. Theoretical foundation

### 2.1. Technophobia and anxiety

Specifically, anxiety (e.g. computer anxiety) should not be confused with holding a negative attitude (e.g. negative attitude toward computers), which involves beliefs and feelings regarding computer-related technology rather than emotional responses toward using technology (Heinssen, Glass, & Knight, 1984, 1987). 

Moreover, negative attitudes may not significantly impact actual advanced-technology-related behaviors (Nomura et al., 2006). Therefore, this study focuses on anxiety in order to discover the deeper, internal factors that are associated with AI.

### 2.2. Conceptualization of AIA

Establishing a conceptual definition and theoretical meaning for constructs is a critical part of developing reliable measures and obtaining useful and effective results (Gerbing & Anderson, 1988). 

Although the fields of computer anxiety and robot anxiety have been studied in great detail, the effects of AIA remain largely unknown. Based on prior anxiety studies conducted in the AI field (e.g. Johnson & Verdicchio, 2017), AIA may be defined as an overall, affective response of anxiety or fear that inhibits an individual from interacting with AI.

Moreover, AIA in the present research context focuses on the variable itself, rather than the process of response or model evaluation, which promotes the operation of AIA as a single variable, independent of numerous antecedents or consequences.

### 2.3. A theoretical framework for assessing AIA

The phrase “AI anxiety” refers to feelings of fear or agitation about out-of-control AI (Johnson & Verdicchio, 2017).

As the main purpose of developing an AIA measure is to predict behavior, measuring self-perceived fear and unease about AI technologies/products is necessarily closely linked to behavior theory.
