## I.Introduction
> denoising problem intro

Image denoising is an ill-posed inverse problem to recover a clean image x from the observed noisy image y=x+no

Previously supervised denoising networks unavoidably suffer from a domain gap problem: both the image priors and noise statistics in training are different from those of the real-world test images.

> Paper strategy

We propose a “Noisy-As-Clean” (NAC) strategy for training self-supervised denoising networks. In our NAC, we directly train an image-specific network by taking the corrupted image y=x+no as the “clean” target.
