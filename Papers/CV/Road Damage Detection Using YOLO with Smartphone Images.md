## Abstract

| Type       | Description                                                                                                                    |

| Background | Deep learning-based technology is a good key to unlock the object detection tasks in our real world.                           |
| Problem    | we could break a problem that is dangerous and very time-consuming but has to be done every day like detecting the road state. |
| Method     | using YOLO to detect the various types of road damage                                                                          |
| Steps      |                                                                                                                                |
| Exception  |                                                                                                                                |
| Contribute | We achieved an F1 score of 0.58 using our ensemble model with TTA                                                              |
| Limitation |                                                                                                                                |
